# eAUDIT
eAUDIT is a project I am workng on for a SANS (https://www.sans.org) Gold paper. This repo contains a library I use 
to interact with the eAUDIT database as well as a batch operations program that demonstrate how to load audit data 
from an Excel spreadhseet.

The code kept here is to be used in conjunction of my paper, which should be published in late June 2015.
