# eAUDIT
eAUDIT is a project I am workng on and which was the basis for a SANS (https://www.sans.org) Gold paper. The paper was published in June of 2015 and can be downloaded at the following URL

https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/auditing/eaudit-designing-generic-tool-review-entitlements-36027

The paper covered the high-level design and implementation of eAUDIT. I am still working on the tool for a presentation I will be doing at SANS NETSEC 2015 in Las Vegas. 

This repo contains a library I use to interact with the eAUDIT database as well as a batch operations program that demonstrate how to load audit data from an Excel spreadhseet.

Note that the data model presented in my gold paper has changed slightly since the publication of the paper. The code and files in this repo reflect the new data model.
