# eAUDIT
eAUDIT is a project I worked on which formed the basis of a SANS Gold paper (https://www.sans.org) published in June of 2015. The paper can be downloaded here: https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/auditing/eaudit-designing-generic-tool-review-entitlements-36027. I also presented my paper during the 2015 SANS conference in Las Vegas. The paper & prosentation cover the high-level design and implementation of eAUDIT. 

This project was eventually implemented at my workplace, and the tool is still in use today. 

I am no longer involved with the tool, but I am leaving my original code here in case it might be of interest to someone trying to solve the problem I addressed with eAUDIT : <i>how do you audit user entitlements in an environment where you do not have the luxusry of a fully automated RBAC implementation.</i>

Please note that the data model presented in my gold paper has changed slightly since the publication of the paper. The code and files in this repo reflect the new data model.
